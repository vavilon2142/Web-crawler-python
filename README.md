# Web-crawler-python
Web crawler on python, using bs4 as a html parser.
Inside of the Crawler file you can tweak the functions and "/" as a starting url symbol, put any other so that crawler can go beyound just downloading the links from website.

All you have to do is to give him a url and a start_anchor(symbol) at which he is going to start looking.

By default it will give you all the links and the total number of them.
Enjoy this little toy :)
